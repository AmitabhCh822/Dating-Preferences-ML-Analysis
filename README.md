# Dating Preferences ML Analysis

This repository is dedicated to analyzing and predicting dating preferences using machine learning and statistical methods. The dataset encompasses various attributes such as the frequency of playing games, ice cream consumption habits, and distance traveled, which are then used to predict the level of interest in a potential dating scenario.

## Repository Structure

- `dating.csv` - The primary dataset for the analysis, containing user attributes and dating preferences.
- `analysis.R` - The R script that performs statistical analysis and machine learning model training.
- `visualizations/` - A directory containing graphical representations of the data and analysis outcomes.
- `models/` - Serialized versions of trained machine learning models ready for deployment or further testing.

## Analysis and Machine Learning Pipeline

The project pipeline includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often with visual methods.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Crafting and selecting appropriate features for machine learning models.
4. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Applying different algorithms to predict dating preferences based on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to interpret the data and model results more intuitively.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure R, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks are installed along with necessary libraries such as `ggplot2`, `sklearn`, and others.
3. Execute the `analysis.R` script to perform the statistical analysis and model training.
4. Explore the `visualizations/` directory to see the graphical representations of the data.
